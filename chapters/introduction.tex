In Software Development, remote working has become increasingly popular over the past years. Due to the  Covid-19 pandemic, this trend has grown even stronger, forcing many companies and their employees to work from home (TODO: CITE). Further, the majority of managers expect to have more flexible work from home policies post-pandemic, and employees would like to continue working from home at least partially \autocite{msworkindexconnection}, making the topic very much relevant also after the pandemic.

While working from home has numerous benefits, it also comes with a range of challenges. On the benefits side, employers can realize savings in real estate costs, and the employee can benefit from more flexible work hours and spending less time and money commuting \autocite{mulki2009set}. However, shared challenges from working from home are that communication is reduced \autocite{kraut1988patterns} and suffers in quality \autocite{mulki2009set}. More specifically, informal communication drastically reduces when working from home \autocite{hinds2005understanding}. This reduction of informal communication can lead to difficulties building trust, maintaining work relationships, or not feeling attached to the team \autocite{comella2020revisiting, olson2006bridging}. Another consequence of remote work is the feeling of workplace isolation \autocite{mulki2009set, marshall2007workplace}. The feeling of isolation leads to not knowing whom to turn to in case of a problem or not feeling part of the company and is said to be caused by missing support from co-workers and opportunities for social and emotional interactions in a team \autocite{marshall2007workplace}. The pandemic further reinforces this influence leading to almost 60\% feeling less connected to their co-workers compared to before the pandemic \autocite{msworkindexconnection}. Since strong team cohesion has been shown to have a positive impact on the team's effectiveness and productivity \autocite{carlson2017virtual}, and the feeling of being disconnected from colleagues have been shown to impede engaging in productive tasks \autocite{lostFocus2020}, the connectedness with the team is of particular interest to us.

A lack of awareness causes the challenges of working remotely: less information about co-workers is exchanged, e.g., no or fewer cues are available to identify team members' interruptibility or emotional states. This missing information makes it a lot harder to find opportune moments to initiate a conversation because it is often unknown whether a person might be in a deep focus state or whether a person might be more than happy to chat. Informal communication is further challenged because serendipity is missing when working remotely because people no longer randomly bump into each other at the water cooler or the coffee machine. Therefore, improving awareness in the workplace is the foundation of our approach.

While there are several prior approaches to improve awareness within teams by showing the current coding tasks and work items that others are working on \autocite{biehl2007fastdash, jakobsen2009wipdash}, they do not focus on the person behind that work item. They thus do not put teams into the center of attention. To make this point stronger, recent research shows concerning numbers in regards to workers' well-being and mental health, stating that the pandemic has led to an increase in stress for 65.9\% of people and 44.4\% reported a decrease in mental health \autocite{qualtricksmental}. Therefore, our concept, AmbientTeams, follows a different approach by \enquote{putting people first}. It includes an ambient always-on-top overview of the core team members and their moods, status messages, and other states. In addition to such a microblogging approach, where team members can share information about their moods (and potential context), we aim to study further possibilities to foster and motivate serendipitous, informal exchanges with the team.

% In the next chapter, existing approaches and their underlying concepts are discussed before introducing our approach and its differences. The resulting prototype is then introduced in \autoref{chapter:prototype} and analyzed in the scope of a preliminary evaluation in \autoref{chapter:preliminary_evaluation}.


\section{Research Questions}
\label{section:research_questions}
Three main areas of interest and the research questions we would like to answer in the scope of this master thesis are as follows.

\medskip\noindent\textbf{Information Sharing}

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ1}: Is there a need for an informal exchange of different states with team members, and what are the reasons? (e.g., share your status with them to indicate states or know more about your team)

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ2}: What are knowledge workers willing to share with their team? (is that impacted by what others on the team are sharing?)

\medskip\noindent\textbf{Impacts}

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ3}: What are the effects of Ambient Teams?

\setlength{\leftskip}{0.5cm}
\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ3.1}: Do mood and state sharing increase the awareness between team members, and how? What do they learn from each other?

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ3.2}: Does it make users feel better to share information with their team?

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ3.3}: Does it stress/relax users to see more about their team?

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ3.4}: Does AmbientTeams reduce the feeling of isolation in remote knowledge work teams?

\setlength{\leftskip}{0pt}

\medskip\noindent\textbf{Tool usage and workflows}

\smallskip\noindent\textit{RQ4}: How do knowledge workers use and interact with AmbientTeams? How do they integrate it into existing workflows?


How do we plan on answering the RQs?

What are the results?

\section{Main Contributions}
The main contributions of this work include
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Development of a mood-sharing approach that allows moods to be shared with the team with minimal effort
    \item Conduct of a preliminary study of an approach that will lead to insights into the mood and status sharing behaviors within knowledge work teams and the impact such sharing can have on personal relationships, workplace isolation, or collaboration
    \item Provision and initial testing of a study design that can be used for a more comprehensive study, along with suggestions for future features that resulted
\end{enumerate}
