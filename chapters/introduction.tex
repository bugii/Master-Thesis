\chapter{Introduction}
In Software Development working remotely has become very popular over the past years. Due to the  Covid-19 pandemic this trend has grown even stronger, forcing many companies and their employees to work from home. While working from home has numerous benefits, it also comes with a range of challenges. On the benefits side, employers can realize savings in real estate costs and the employee can benefit from more flexible work hours and spending less time and money commuting \cite{mulki2009set}. However, common challenges from working from home are that communication is reduced \cite{kraut1988patterns} and suffers in quality \cite{mulki2009set}. More specifically, informal communication is drastically reduced when working from home \cite{hinds2005understanding}. This can lead to difficulties building trust, maintaining work relationships, or not feeling attached to the team \cite{comella2020revisiting, olson2006bridging}. The pandemic further reinforces this influence leading to almost 60\% feeling less connected to their co-workers compared to before the pandemic \cite{msworkindexconnection}. Since strong team cohesion has been shown to have a positive impact on the team's effectiveness and productivity \cite{carlson2017virtual}, it is important to foster informal communication in a remote work setting.

(Informal) communication is challenged due to the loss of team awareness when working remotely: less information about co-workers is exchanged, e.g. no or less cues are available to identify the interruptibility or emotional states of team members. This makes it a lot harder to find opportune moments to initiate a conversation because it is often unknown whether a person might be in a deep focus state, or whether a person might be more than happy to chat. Informal communication is further challenged because serendipity is missing when working remotely because people are no longer randomly bumping into each other at the water cooler or the coffee machine.

While there are several prior approaches which aim to increase team awareness by showing the current coding tasks and work items that others are working on \cite{biehl2007fastdash, jakobsen2009wipdash}, none of them focus on the person behind that work item and put teams into the center of attention. To make this point stronger, recent research shows concerning number in regards to workers' well-being and mental health stating that the pandemic has led to an increase in stress for 65.9\% of people and 44.4\% reported a decrease in mental health \cite{qualtricksmental}. Therefore, our concept, Ambient Teams, follows a different approach by ``putting the team first''. It does so by showing a quick overview of the core team members, and providing additional information about their moods and states. We aim to study different ``Enablers'' to initiate spontaneous, serendipitous communication with the team, while keeping interruptions at in-opportune moments low.
